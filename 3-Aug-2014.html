At USER END:

While Registration:
A default spot having name "user-1" for the new user having user name "user" will be created.


At login page:
In the "Pick Table(s)", the pick of a "User" is shown. Suppose a user "A" have 3 spots, A-1,A-2,A-3. And from A-1 pick is "Bengals" from A-2 pick is "Giant" and from A-3 pick is "Bills"
Then the row of table will be like: 
A : Bengals | Giant | Bills
i.e picks of all the users, separated by pipe(|).

After successful login, instead of directing to index.php , u are redirected to choose_spot.php where you choose your default spot. And then you are redirected back to your home
There, you have spot-name with 'coloured' activation state indication. And the "Current Pool Point"
Then the Picks show only the picks of the spot from which you are logged in.

In "My Pick Details":
There are 2 funtionalities present there.
a) Coloured Picks Table: It shows all the picks of the particular 'USER' spot-wise who is logged in. and the lcolour in spotID is according to the current spot's State.
Suppose you are "Active" and you picked a team then the team and spotID will be in green colour. But after result updation, if the chosen team looses the match then the 
team as well spotID cell's colour will be changed to Orange(for Deactivation). And the the colour associated with the team after the result-updation will remain fixed.

b) Pick Table: It have the list of picked team by the logged-in spot. And the state of pick(Delete it/Already Locked) is associated with it.
And user can make changes for the picked team from here only but only if, the team is not locked by the Admin.



Register Spot(or I better say "Manage Spot"):
Have 3 options:
a)"Change the Current Spot": If user wants to switch his/her spot then  it is done through this link.
b)"Create new Spot": on clicking on "Create" automatically a new spot will be created and the user have the right to delete it before it is verified.
c) "Delete unverified Spots": From here you can delete the unverified spots.


Results link:
Here you will get the All users(according to there spot) Result. I is similar to the "Coloured Pick Table" but the only difference is-
It shows the result of each and every "verified" spot.
It doesn't shows the pick of a spot until it is locked and result is uploaded.



At ADMIN end:

"Set default Pick": Enter the week number and you have a list of all the matches in that week along with an option saying-
"Look for users with No Picks: <button>Look for them</button>"
On clicking the button you are supplied with the list of spotID who hadn't made pick for "that particular week".

In "Reactivate" and "Verify" link-

Added the option reactivate/verify the spot also.
(But, now I think that there is no use/ existence of the term "verify user" or "reactivate user" as all the work is done only with the spot, irrespective of the Activation state of user)
Should I remove it?
